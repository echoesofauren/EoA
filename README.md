## 📖 PROJECT INTRODUCTION
Hey everyone, my name is **Congchi**, and I'm incredibly excited (and nervous!) to share the first public version of my passion project, *Echoes of Auren*.
Instead of focusing on graphics, I wanted to create a world built from **words**, where your imagination is the most powerful engine. You play as one of the few who can hear the **"Echoes"** of the past, and it's up to you to uncover the forgotten truth.
## ✨ PROUD FEATURES
These are some elements I am particularly proud of in the game:
* **Branching Main Quest:** A core storyline with choices that genuinely affect the world and the ending.
* **Hidden "Memory Chains":** Side stories told through secret memory chains, without any traditional quest markers.
* **Unique Combat System:** Specific enemy mechanics (try fighting a Ghost without the right gear!).
* **A World That Changes:** The environment and NPCs react based on your actions and discoveries.
## 🤝 FEEDBACK WELCOME
This is a public test build, so all feedback is incredibly valuable! I'd love to know what you think about the story, the gameplay, or any bugs you might find.

**Thank you for taking the time to check it out!**
